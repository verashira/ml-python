Web Traffic Linear Fit
----------------------

* **Least Square Fit**

### Notes

* It is a very start for us into the machine learning.  
We simply apply the **polyfit**, another form of **Least Square Algorithm**,  
to get a fit line of a series of data.

* Digree of the polynomial is the most important parameter worthy of attention,  
and maybe also the only one. It will greatly concerns the correctness of the  
final model, whether it will be overfitting or underfitting.

* We can get a best fit line, at least in **Statistics**, of the least hypothesis
error.
