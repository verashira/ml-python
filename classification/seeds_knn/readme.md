Seeds data set kNN
------------------

* **kNN**

### Notes

* The Seeds data set is similar to Iris data set, with 7 features and 
3 classes to identify.

* kNN algorithm is straight forward, and we classify a new example based
on the samples existed close to it.

* Nearest neighbors are used to determine the classes, finally we use
pyplot.pcolormesh to draw a decision map to show the class areas determined
by nearest neightbors.
