Iris data set Linear Boundary
-----------------------------

* **Simple Linear Boundary**

### Notes

* We start to do classification work to identify things. And in this example,
we try to find a linear boundary for classifying three types of Iris flowers.

* Which feature to chosen for finding the boundary is the most important thing
we should concern about.

* We first choose the petal width to divide the **setosa** from the other two.
And apply a brute forth search find a feature dividing the remaining **two flowers**
with a smallest error rate.

* Very simple algorithm but may take effect in some areas. Its disadvantages are
also obvious for it can only express linear boundary and be hard extends to
high dimensions.
